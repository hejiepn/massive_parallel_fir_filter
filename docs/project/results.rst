Results
=======

*Interesting* results of your project: e.g. benchmarks, measurements, photos, pictures, (processed) simulation input/output.

Example "Pacman": Plot of frames per second vs. number of animated characters, screenshots of the game, short video of a game with the most important animations and sound effects.

Additional results

* link to local copy (within git!) of your presentation slides for the mid- and final presentations in pdf format
* link to your video for the final presentations (outside git !)

*Note: For a "real" (=taped out) SOC a system level verification covering all modules is the most important task. However a "full" (=high functional and code coverage), automated system verification can not be achieved in this project, as it would (at least) double the effort. Thus this chapter is called "results" and not "verification".*
